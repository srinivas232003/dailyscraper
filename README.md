I developed a Flask app for scraping headlines from an open news website. The app, hosted on Heroku, uses APScheduler for daily scraping and stores data in a PostgreSQL database. I utilized Microsoft Azure Storage Blob to store the CSV file generated by the app, ensuring data management and storage are efficient and free from duplicates.
